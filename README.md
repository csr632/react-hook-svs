# react-hook-svs

Implement shared services using React hooks. Organize your data layer clearly and concisely. `react-hook-svs` aims to be your last state management library.

What I mean by state management(or data layer, or data model):

- You can declare several state stores to host shared states. You can also use a single BIG store to host all your states. Anyway, it is recommended to make your states to form a tree structure that reflect the structure of your application.
- The state store should contain some routines(functions) to update the states. The update routines can be sync or async. Consumer should trigger data update by calling these routines, instead of set data fields by hand.
  - This practice makes your data model well-encapsulated, leading to better code reuse and less bugs.
- The descendant components(consumers) can read the shared state. When the shared state is updated, consumers should automatically re-render. This is called reactive.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -S react-hook-svs
```

## Basic demo

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { createSvs } from "react-hook-svs";

// Services often declare state and state-updating routines
const CounterSvs = createSvs((scope, initial) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initial);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);
  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  return { count, decrement, increment };
});

export default function App() {
  /**
   * Make App component be the host of CounterSvs.
   * You can get the service output immediately in the hosting component,
   * without need to wrap it in a HOC.
   */
  const [scope, { count, increment }] = CounterSvs.useProvideNewScope(10);
  // scope.injectTo make the service output available in this subtree
  return scope.injectTo(
    <div className="App">
      <p>
        Use count in Host: {count} <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      </p>
      <div>
        Use count in Children:
        <CounterDisplay />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function CounterDisplay() {
  // find CounterSvs from react context
  const { count, decrement, increment } = CounterSvs.useCtxConsume();
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Basic features

- Typescript first. Get full power of intellisense and type-checking. No string-based action type dispatch like redux. Let type system do most works for you.
- By taking take full advantage of react hooks, you can get better logic reuse & code organization. You can benefit from all the awesome hook libraries from react community.
- Easy to learn. We embrace the mind model of React and hooks, with only two new concept(Service and Scope). The library source code is **only 100 lines of code**, and many of them are just Typescript type notation.

## Key ideas and demos

- Get service output immediately in the hosting component. You **no longer need to wrap your top component with provider HOC** to get service output in it.
  - Formerly(without `react-hook-svs`), if you want to get service output in the top component, you are forced to lift the service up: wrap your top component with provider HOC, then use `useContext(ServiceCtx)` in your top component to get the service output. But with `react-hook-svs`, you just run the service in the hosting component, and the output is returned immediately(just like normal hooks).
  - This is one of the major advantages compared with [unstated-next](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated-next). This helps you to reduce boilerplate code.
  - [The basic demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/csr632/react-hook-svs/tree/master/src?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&moduleview=1&theme=dark) illustrates that.
- Besides composing with normal React hooks, `react-hook-svs` give you even more composability: **service composition**. **Service composition is achieved by running two services in the same scope, so the latter ones can consume the former ones.** Service composition give you following benefits:
  - **One service can consume another, even when they are in the same component.** `react-hook-svs` provides a consistent way to consume service: `scope.useConsumeSvs`. It will first try to find service in current component(in the scope), and fallback to React context.
    - Traditionally(without `react-hook-svs`), Different service in the same component can not interact. (Unless you pass data as hook parameters, but that will make your hook API hard to use.) Different services have to be in different level of component tree in order to consume each other. To satisfy this requirement, you often end up in nested HOCs or provider hell.
  - **Service providers(basically React context) are composited together and will be injected into a JSX subtree at once**.
    - Traditionally(without `react-hook-svs`), we use React context to achieve service composition:`<Provider1> <Provider2> <Provider3> <App /> </Provider3> </Provider2> </Provider1>` (the inner ones can depend on the outer ones). If you get a lot of providers, you will end up in [provider hell](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated-next/issues/35). But with `react-hook-svs`, you can achieve exactly the same with **chaining**(the latter ones can depend on the former ones).
  - This is one of the major advantages compared with [unstated-next](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated-next). This will make your services more composable and your JSX tree cleaner.
  - [See this demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/csr632/react-hook-svs/tree/master/src?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fdemos%2Fcomposition.tsx&moduleview=1&theme=dark).
  - Sidenote: Services can be either isolated or accessible, depending on whether they are in same scope family. When you run a service inside a scope, `react-hook-svs` will create a child scope to be the running enviroment of that service. The "parent scope - child scope" structure will form a "enviroment tree" to resolve/isolate services properly. It just works like enviroment model of most programing languages.
- **Service abstraction**.
  - Normal React hooks abstraction: the caller of a hook can't know whether the hook call other hooks in it. The nesting hook call is abstracted away by the parent hook.
  - Beside normal React hooks abstraction, `react-hook-svs` gives you service abstraction: SvsA can run(instead of consume) SvsB inside it, but the users of SvsA will not feel the existance of SvsB: **SvsB will not be visible in the scope and React context. SvsA can choose to re-export and re-name the output of SvsB to make it visible**. This is similar to how nested esModules or nested function calls work.
  - [See this demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/csr632/react-hook-svs/tree/master/src?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fdemos%2Fabstraction.tsx&moduleview=1&theme=dark).
- **Precise control of service visibility**. You can make a scope(which contains some services' output) only visible to a portion of children. You can make two children consume same kind of service, but two independent outputs.
  - [unstated-next](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated-next) can not do that because you need to wrap you component with HOC to consume the service output. The HOC service will be visible to all its children.
  - [See this demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/csr632/react-hook-svs/tree/master/src?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fdemos%2Findependent-run.tsx&moduleview=1&theme=dark).

## APIs

### Service

A service is a special hook, whose output are shared through scope object and React context. It is just like the "container" in [unstated-next](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated-next), and "data model" in other state management library.

#### createSvs

Take a hook and return a service object.

```ts
function createSvs<Input extends any[], Output>(
  useHook: (scope: IScope, ...input: Input) => Output
): ISvs<Input, Output>;
```

The service object have the following interface:

```ts
interface ISvs<Input extends any[], Output> {
  /**
   * Shorthand for `const scope = useScope(); const output = scope.useProvideSvs(svs, ...input);`
   */
  useProvideNewScope(...input: Input): readonly [IScope, Output];
  /**
   * Find nearest service output from ancestor components.
   * When optional==true, return NOT_FOUND when service not found.
   * Otherwise, throw error when service not found.
   */
  useCtxConsume(): Output;
  useCtxConsume(optional: boolean): Output | typeof NOT_FOUND;
}
```

### Scope

Any service must be run in a "scope object". A service can access other services that is run in the same "scope". (A service can also access other services from React context.)

Scope object will collect all the context providers of its services, and inject into a JSX at once, saving you from provider hell!

#### useScope

Create a new scope object.

```ts
function useScope(): IScope;
```

The scope object have the following interface:

```ts
interface IScope {
  /**
   * Create a **child scope** of **this scope**.
   * Run the service in the **child scope**.
   * Put the service output in **this scope**.
   * The output will be visible by following services in this scope and the component subtree wrapped by `injectTo`.
   *
   * The "parent scope - child scope" structure will form a "enviroment tree" to resolve context requests properly.
   * It just works like enviroment model of most programing languages.
   */
  useProvideSvs<Input extends any[], Output>(
    svs: ISvs<Input, Output>,
    ...input: Input
  ): Output;
  /**
   * Create a **child scope** of **this scope**.
   * Run the service in the **child scope**.
   * Don't put the service output in **this scope**.
   */
  useRunSvs<Input extends any[], Output>(
    _svs: ISvs<Input, Output>,
    ...input: Input
  ): Output;
  /**
   * Find a service output from this scope, or its ancestor scope, or React context.
   */
  useConsumeSvs<Input extends any[], Output>(svs: ISvs<Input, Output>): Output;
  useConsumeSvs<Input extends any[], Output>(
    svs: ISvs<Input, Output>,
    optional: boolean
  ): Output | typeof NOT_FOUND;
  /**
   * Make the service outputs in this scope be visible by the wrapped JSX subtree. So that descendant components can consume them.
   * It takes a JSX tree, wrap it with React context provider, and return a new JSX tree that you should render.
   */
  injectTo: (children?: React.ReactNode) => React.ReactNode;
  /**
   * Create a child scope.
   * Finding a service output in a scope works like JS prototype chain.
   * You don't need to call this API manually in most cases.
   */
  createChild(): IScope;
}
```
